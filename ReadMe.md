1st step was to create the Html that has two different sections ( the input of where the task are typed ) (the section where the Task are shown and editied. )

2nd step was to add id's into my input tags so they could be called later to be styled and called in the javascript.

3rd step was to Link the Html to the Javascript files so that everything can function later on.

4th step was to style the Html. I decied to go with Spooky theme for my project. I had to add a font into my document to really solidify that it was spooky themed. everything else is just common CSS styling and Color cordination. Making sure everyhting has some kind of harmony

5th step was to make sure that the CSS that i jst created was responsive. So i went back and added media Quieres.

6th step was to start working on the Javascript ( ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT PARTS ) I coded along a video I found online but I understand the code. We started by making an Evenlistener that will run the following code when the page loads. right below that I added some const that linked to my task form , input and ,task ID's .

7th (MORE JAVASCRIPT) Next I linked the sumbit input so that whenever we clicked submit it would add it to the task section and I also added if there was nothing in the input feild it would send an alert to make it say "Add a Task" .

8th step (EVEN MORE JAVASCRIPT) Next up was to make a const create more divs when we added more task. After that we wanted to make sure that the content of that task is added as well.

9th step(EVEN MORE MORE JAVASCRIPT) Next we created the Javascript for our buttons so that when we clicked on them it will either edit what is in the InnerHTMl or completely remove the div all together.

10th step is to create a Json file Where all of the task are stored and edited and saved and removed. This is the part where I had alot of trouble with. I am unsure of where to even start this step. I guess I should start by Making a JSON file where all of my task will be inputed into. Next I will need to find a way where when the task are typed and submitted into the task input filed it sends it to the Json file.
